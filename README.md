# Hi there, I'm Alfonso 👋

I'm a full-stack developer living in Mexico City. For the past 15 years, I've been crafting software for a variety of companies worldwide, alongside a few personal projects of my own.

👨‍💻 Currently, I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer by day at [Ark Ecosystem](https://ark.io), and by night, I work on interesting side projects.

💻 My tech stack includes, but is not limited to, Laravel, VueJs, React, Next.js, PHP, SQL, JS, TypeScript, and more.

📝 In my spare time, you can find me engrossed in a good book, binge-watching a new TV series, spending quality time with my kids, or training for triathlons.
