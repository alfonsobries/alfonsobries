# Hi there, I'm Alfonso 👋

I'm a full-stack developer living in Mérida Yucatán. For the past 15 years, I've been crafting software for a variety of companies worldwide, alongside a few personal projects of my own.

👨‍💻 Currently, I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer by day at [Ark Ecosystem](https://ark.io), and by night, I work on interesting side projects.

💻 My tech stack includes, but is not limited to, Laravel, VueJs, React, Next.js, PHP, SQL, JS, TypeScript, and more.

📝 When I'm not coding, I'm probably chilling with a good book, catching up on my favorite TV shows, goofing around with my kids, or sweating it out in triathlon training.
